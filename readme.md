NiceFart.io
===========

The game code for [nicefart.io](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nicefart.io).

I want to share this code because the game is down right now, and i think this could help other people who want to make a mmo. 
You'll find here the client source based in pixi.js, for browsers and cocoon.io developed with typescript. Also two servers, one developed in node.js as a concept proof, and other in golang, which is the "real" server used in production for a year.

This project was my first attempt to create a mmo, and my first project in production using golang, so the code it's a little mess.

The repository doesn't have the images used in game because all of them are a work of a [friend](), not mine. 

Don't expect this code to just work, i don't maintain it. It's just for study purposes.
